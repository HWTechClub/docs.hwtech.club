## Warning About Fake News

There is a lot of mis-information regarding the coronavirus vaccine, which has
no scientific (or even logical) basis.

At the time of writing this (4th February), almost three million doses of the
vaccine has been inoculated in the UAE. If the vaccine caused serious side
effects, there would have been a crisis.

[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/) is a great fact-checking
website, you can use it to check the facts behind the rumours.

### Fact checking


#### Vaccine doesn't work against the South African variant

It does work, but the protection is weaker.

#### Does the vaccine cause infertility

No.

#### The vaccine might not work against different variants

As mutations increase, the vaccine might be adapted. There might be a need for
annual vaccinations against COVID according to the UAE health sector.

For now, we need to get vaccinated to prevent more mutations of the virus from
evolving.

#### The vaccine is part of a global conspiracy theory

The Metro has a [great article debunking theories and
myths](https://metro.co.uk/2020/12/03/covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories-and-myths-debunked-13694062/).
