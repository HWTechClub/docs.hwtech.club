## Warning About Fake News

There is a lot of mis-information regarding the coronavirus vaccine, which has
no scientific (or even logical) basis.

At the time of writing this (21st of March), over **seven million** doses of
the vaccine has been inoculated in the UAE. If the vaccine caused serious side
effects, there would have been a crisis.

[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/) is a great fact-checking
website, you can use it to check the facts behind the rumours.
