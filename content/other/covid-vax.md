- Dubai (DHA): [800 342](tel:800342) (800 DHA)
- MoHaP: [800 1111](tel:8001111)

If residing outside of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, book appointments at the Ministry
of Health and Prevention (MoHaP). MoHaP also has clinics in Dubai.

Currently, DHA provides the Pfizer-BioNTec vaccine, while SEHA and MoHaP
provides the CNBG (Chinese) vaccine. Both are highly effective, any of the two
vaccines are sufficient.

**Note:** Being vaccinated does not exempt you from wearing masks or getting
tested. Vaccines does not really give you a protective aura against the virus.
There is still a chance you may be infected and infect others, albeit you will
hopefully not be as symptomatic and the contagious period would be much
shorter.

Please still follow all the preventative measures against COVID-19, there are
people who got infected after the first dose as they let their guards down.

## Warning About Fake News

There is a lot of mis-information regarding the coronavirus vaccine, which has
no scientific (or even logical) basis.

At the time of writing this (12th January), over a million doses of the vaccine
has been inoculated in the UAE. If the vaccine caused serious side effects,
there would have been a crisis.

[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/) is a great fact-checking
website, you can use it to check the facts behind the rumours.
