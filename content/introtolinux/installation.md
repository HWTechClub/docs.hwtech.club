#### Linux

Well if your already using linux as your host operating system, then most if not all commands would work natively.  

*Optional*: Setup a VM with a fresh OS install and follow through the guide.

#### Windows

For Windows, especially for those of you with Windows 10, [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/ "Windows Subsystem for Linux") would be very convenient as it involves quick and easy setup. Preferably use WSL2 as it runs a lightweight linux machine virtualized, at the cost of negligible disk IO speed, but that wouldn't be noticeable for everyday use.

Follow the official MSDN Guide for [Installation of WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 "Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10").

For those of using older versions of Windows, or if WSL isn't for you, Virtual Machines are recommended. We suggest using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Virtual Box") due to its OpenSource nature.

Please search up for guides and installation tutorials as due to the sheer vastness of linux distributions, it is time consuming and also hard to write a conclusive tutorial. But feel free to reach out to the members for any guidance and help.

#### macOS

Virtual Machines are recommended. We suggest using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Virtual Box") due to its OpenSource nature.

 **TODO:** Someone with a macOS fill this!
