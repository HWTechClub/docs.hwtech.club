# Introduction to Linux

Linux is a free, open-source operating system.

Newcomers to Linux may find it difficult to approach the structure of an unfamiliar operating system.

This guide gently introduces key terminal skills and equips newcomers to learn more about Linux.

We want to show you how to make the most of the tools you know, show you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own.

This guide is based on [./missing-semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ "The Missing Semester of Your CS Education")
